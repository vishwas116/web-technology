# User Auth App (Angular)

Very basic frontend-only auth using `localStorage`.

## Features
- Register user (stores `name`, `email`, `password` in localStorage)
- Login user (verifies email/password)
- Profile page (shows logged-in user data)
- Logout

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm start
# or: ng serve

# App will be at http://localhost:4200
```

## Angular CLI (if missing)
```bash
npm i -g @angular/cli
```

## Notes
- No backend. This is for learning/demo only.
- Users are stored in browser localStorage.
